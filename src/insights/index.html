            <h2>COVID Modelling Parameter Automation</h2>
            <p>
              Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) assisted with automating parameters
              for an extensive COVID modelling endeavour.
            </p>
            <h3>The pandemic’s impact on mining</h3>
            <p>
              The commodities market is no stranger to external shocks and
              already early on in the pandemic, analysts were scrambling to
              quantify how COVID-19 would affect mining operations globally. A
              data science company specialising in health care modelling was
              contracted by an international mining conglomerate to construct a
              compartment model to track the Covid 19 epidemic’s impact on their
              operations worldwide.
            </p>
            <h3>COVID modelling parameter automation</h3>
            <p>
              The compartment model’s parameters were fitted by choosing
              reasonable values and running an extensive grid search around
              these values on a cluster. However, given that the model could
              accommodate up to 60 parameters, the computationally costly
              process proved problematic to repeat as new data became available.
              Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) was approached to assist to
              automate and simplify the fitting of the model. Parameter fitting
              was made less complex by implementing a gradient descent with
              multiple live points, after a few rounds of which, a Markov Chain
              Monte Carlo (MCMC) was run on each live point. The best results
              were used as summary statistics for the parameter space. The
              algorithms were implemented in an Approximate Bayesian Computation
              framework and parallelized in an R package to run on an Azure
              server. This removed the need to manually fit the model and run an
              expensive grid search, saving many person-hours and giving better
              results.
            </p>
            <h3>Client’s feedback</h3>
            <p>
              Matogen AI’s interdisciplinary team has a lot of experience
              applying advanced statistics and machine learning for predictive
              modelling, but they also recognise the power of human intelligence
              so they are about the synergy of human and machine intelligence. I
              have been working very closely with the team over the past six
              months and they are truly an amazing group of people. Not only do
              they produce top quality results in a very time efficient way,
              they also operate from the core values of integrity, respect,
              sustainability and social impact.”

              chronic conditions in people age 50 and older. In the United

              Given their advanced analytics capabilities within the health
              sector, MAI was able to thoroughly investigate the outcomes and
              risk factors of patients with dismineral diseases undergoing
              orthopaedic procedures such as hip and knee arthroplasty, as well
              as spinal fusion. <br /><br />

              The MAI data scientist examined millions of data records ranging
              from 2008 to 2014 from a national database. ICD9 codes were used
              to filter the data and extract records related to the relevant
              diseases and orthopaedic procedures.

              SAS software was used to wrangle the colossal dataset into a chart
              tabulating unique combinations of variable values and their
              frequency in the dataset. Continuous variables such as
              length-of-stay and total cost were aggregated. Many
              cross-tabulations were generated from the frequency table to glean
              insights and trends from the data.

              The outcome variable of most interest in this project was the

              pinpoint the precise combinations of demographics, mineral
              deficiency, and operative procedures that most highly correlated
              with post-procedural mortality.

              Matogen Applied Insights’ (MAI) has successfully completed a wide
              range of innovative data science projects in the agriculture

            <h3>What is Agri 3.0?</h3>
            <p>
              An interesting outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant
              lockdown in South Africa is that it brought into relief the notion
              of “essential services”. Suddenly, it was emphasised in staggered
              form which activities and enterprises were absolutely critical for
              human survival. Health services, transport and communication were
              highlighted, while societal extras like entertainment and leisure
              were quickly shut down to curb the spread of infections. Panic
              buying at supermarkets was an expression of people’s fear that the
              supply of food, the most essential of essentials, would be
              disrupted. However, to everyone’s great relief, the agricultural
              sector (as well as the other links in the food supply chain) kept
              chugging along more or less as usual. Nevertheless, this scenario
              served as a stark reminder of the importance of the agricultural
              sector. <br /><br />

              Agriculture 3.0 is the term given to describe the “Third
              Agricultural Revolution”, i.e. data science in agriculture, also
              known as “digital farming”. It is characterised by the large-scale
              use of data to drive food production to levels that far outperform
              the two previous agricultural revolutions: mechanisation and
              genetic modification, respectively. Data produced by customised
              farming software products, weather stations, satellite imagery,
              leaf and soil samples, as well as irrigation systems, is measured
              and analysed to optimise yield, efficiency and profitability.
            </p>
            <h3>Data science in agriculture</h3>
            <p>
              To date, Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) has collaborated on a
              variety data science projects within the agriculture sector. These
              range from building customised systems, data wrangling and
              analysis, the construction of predictive models to computer
              vision. This innovative company comprises a team of highly skilled
              individuals from diverse backgrounds. It leverages international
              best practice from the fields of statistics and machine learning
              in synergy with clients’ domain expertise to examine trends and
              impart data-driven insights. This empowers clients to make better
              decisions towards more efficient farming practices, saving time
              and money, as well as limiting wastage. <br /><br />

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              Undertakings within the farming industry include systems such as
              dashboards, bots and electronic alerts for weather risk and crop
              protection spraying conditions, as well as plant disease image
              recognition. In addition, the analysis of agricultural data
              allowed for the identification of trends with regard to growth
              phases, nutrient deficiencies and irrigation. However, it is
              within the realm of predictive analytics that MAI’s unique
              approach and cooperative capabilities position it favourably to
              contribute towards the Third Agricultural Revolution. Completed
              forecasting projects range from the prediction of crop disease
              risk and plant nutrient deficiency, as well as optimal harvest
              date and irrigation practices.

            <h3>Repayment behaviour</h3>
            <p>
              The word “credit” originates from French, via Italian from the
              Latin credere, meaning “believe” or “trust”. In other words,
              credit is extended to people who can be believed or trusted to pay
              it back. In traditional financial services, credit scores
              represent the likelihood of a person repaying a loan and are
              compiled from information about an individual’s repayment
              behaviour, i.e. how they have historically managed previous loans
              or other financial products. It is their past behaviour that
              determines whether they should be trusted or not.
            </p>

            <h3>Thin files</h3>
            <p>
              According to the World Bank, there are 2 billion people around the
              world, mostly in developing countries, who lack access to even the
              most basic banking services. Even in advanced economies, up to 20%
              of consumers’ credit history is either completely lacking or too
              thin to generate a traditional credit score. Given that the word
              credit relates to a person’s trustworthiness, it stands to reason
              that psychology may be a useful tool to assess a person’s
              inclination towards repaying debt according to their personality.
              This could be very useful, especially where information about
              repayment behaviour is absent.
            </p>

            <h3>Theoretical underpinnings</h3>
            <p>
              Psychometric instruments are most commonly used within the human
              resources realm for candidate hiring and conducting assessments at
              different points of the employee cycle. In order to measure the
              psychometric traits that are linked to financial behaviour and
              credit risk, four models (MBTI, Ocean/Big 5, PCL-R, Hogan
              Personality Inventory) were used to cover the traits which
              characterise a good borrower. Intent to repay and financial
              conscientiousness were the main characteristics to be measured.
              The selected traits are supported by extensive primary research
              and pilot studies, for example, inhabitants of four different
              towns in Uttar Pradesh, rural India, provided their credit scores,
              played the game and underwent the MBTI test. The findings were
              very positive.
            </p>

            <h3>Case study</h3>
            <p>
              The idea originated from a chatbot, using NLP mapped to
              psychological elements (based on the Big Five model in psychology)
              to screen prospective rental tenants in the property sector. This
              prototype was tweaked to image-based selection in order to be
              scalable for multiple languages (for example, 207 dialects in
              India!) and actual gamification, which is much more engaging.
              ConfirmU had subsequently developed a short game, constituting
              psychometric tests that deliver an immediate credit score.
            </p>

            <h3>MAI modelling case study</h3>
            <p>
              The case study was performed on data pertaining to loans to
              small-scale dairy farmers in Kenya. The farmers played the game
              and the MAI data science team was able to achieve a high Gini
              coefficient (a measure of predictive strength) overall, as well as
              very high predictive values on out-of-time testing, indicating
              that the model generalises well. The strength of this psychometric
              model was comparable to models built with credit bureau data
              within the unsecured space. <br /><br />
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              Given the transparent modelling technique and the low level of
              correlation with other sources, the scorecard the MAI team built
              off psychometric data is a powerful tool for both thin and thick
              file customers. One of the weaknesses of a traditional “thin file”
              or “new to credit” scorecard is the tendency to lump many
              individuals of the same age or income together, whereas the
              additional psychometric lens considers them differently. The MAI
              scorecard displayed even deciles in the scored population and the
              bad rates of the riskiest decile were three times that of the bad
              rates of the low-risk decile with a steady change. In practice,
              this could translate into giving someone with a lower score a
              smaller amount, instead of just declining them, maximising not
              only profit but also impact and sustainability.
            </p>

            <h3>Localisation</h3>
            <p>
              Traditional credit scorecards are adjusted for different locations
              because even financial data needs to be interpreted within a local
              context. It could be argued that one’s personality profile is
              strongly influenced by one’s culture. Therefore, a major unique
              selling point of the game is that it is customisable – it can be
              adapted to local culture to produce valid results, whether it is
              played in India, Kenya or Vietnam. A pilot study is conducted and
              a bespoke model is built for each new location and potential
              lenders. This is based on an understanding of the practicalities
              and the characteristics of the audience. A link is sent and a
              consumer plays the game, after which a model is constructed based
              on data from the game combined with loan repayment information. It
              would then be very easy to scale the model to other clients in the
              same market.
            </p>

            <h3>Credit and non-credit applications</h3>
            <p>
              The first pilot occurred among rural, micro-entrepreneurial women,
              who are representative of the microfinance industry. ConfirmU is
              currently penetrating the unique segment of agri-lending in Kenya
              amidst a booming digital landscape. In addition, localisation is
              underway to target a metropolitan, young, tech-savvy population
              without a credit history. Non-credit applications potentially
              include buy-now-pay-later platforms, a flourishing segment
              worldwide that is gaining more and more traction in emerging
              markets, as well as insurance and wealth tech. The largest credit
              bureau in the world aims to apply this solution in the property
              tech arena. There is also room for credit scoring in the
              blockchain DeFi (decentralised finance) space where collateral is
              required on lending platforms.

              Using gamification for credit scoring, ConfirmU’s overall vision
              is to become a global alternative credit bureau. Traditional
              models are good, but they don’t actually evaluate the person’s
              intent to repay based on personality.

            <p>
              Given their advanced analytics capabilities within the health
              sector, MAI was able to thoroughly investigate the outcomes and
              risk factors of patients with dismineral diseases undergoing
              orthopaedic procedures such as hip and knee arthroplasty, as well
              as spinal fusion. <br /><br />

              The MAI data scientist examined millions of data records ranging
              from 2008 to 2014 from a national database. ICD9 codes were used
              to filter the data and extract records related to the relevant
              diseases and orthopaedic procedures.

              SAS software was used to wrangle the colossal dataset into a chart
              tabulating unique combinations of variable values and their
              frequency in the dataset. Continuous variables such as
              length-of-stay and total cost were aggregated. Many
              cross-tabulations were generated from the frequency table to glean
              insights and trends from the data.

              The outcome variable of most interest in this project was the

              pinpoint the precise combinations of demographics, mineral
              deficiency, and operative procedures that most highly correlated
              with post-procedural mortality.

            <p>
              Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) employed machine learning to build
              a predictive model to identify individuals who were likely to
              churn, as well as anticipate customer spending.

              is defined as the percentage of customers who moved to a different
              service provider within a given time period. It is a particular
              feature of the telecommunications industry that is of concern to

              profitability.&nbsp; <br /><br />

              An MAI client in the telecoms sector saw considerable potential in
              leveraging their warehoused data to manage voluntary churn.
              Initially, the project aimed to discover and examine the patterns
              of behaviour associated with churn. The MAI data scientists used
              weights of evidence, logistic regression and random forests to
              predict customers that were highly likely to churn, and in
              conjunction with an expert-based approach, alerts were triggered
              to highlight particular accounts. These accounts were forwarded
              into a retention queue for proactive attempts to retain them.
            </p>

            <h3>Spend prediction</h3>
            <p>
              The machine learning techniques employed by the MAI team not only
              helped to manage voluntary churn, but the improved profiling of
              customers enables more targeted and relevant product and service
              offerings in the prepaid customer base especially. This also
              results in an even better understanding of the customer due to a
              longer and deeper relationship. <br /><br />

              After profiling customers in new and insightful ways, the project
              expects to start seeing tangible value from the three selected
              initial use cases. The next steps will be to increase the

              programme is designed to make children more comfortable with
              doctors, nurses and dentists. Through classes and holiday
              programmes, children are exposed to various medical topics,
              including personal safety, hygiene, nutrition, anatomy and
              doctors’ tools. In addition to alleviating any anxiety associated
              with seeking medical treatment, the programme also ultimately aims
              to potentially entice children to seek careers within the world of
              medicine.

            <h3>Junior Medics online platform</h3>
            <p>
              Owing to the social distancing effects of Covid-19 and the
              barriers it brought to the Junior Medics team, MAI helped create
              an online learning platform that allows children to have the whole
              Junior Medics experience and more, despite the pandemic. MAI’s
              software developers were able to provide a customised environment
              with programme-specific content and appropriate accessibility. The
              platform enables Junior Medics teachers, usually junior doctors,
              to upload any content in the form of PDF’s, word documents,
              videos, images, etc. In addition, facilitators are also able to
              set up worksheets in the form of an online quiz, which can be
              monitored by time slot, which enables them to observe how students
              engage with the different content. <br /><br />

              When creditors struggle to collect overdue payments, it usually
              signifies the beginning-of-the-end of their relationship with the
              customer. Apart from improving collection rates on outstanding
              amounts, MAI’s client in the telecoms sector desired stronger
              customer retention, and subsequently, growth. They joined forces
              to embark on a programme of intelligent customer insights to
              manage the customer journey.

              The MAI data science team undertook a comprehensive collections
              diagnostic, in addition to supporting the client’s collections
              team with managing the ‘run down’ book. MAI harnessed the
              foundational components,

              data. Right Party Contact enables the client to get hold of
              delinquent customers, overcoming the challenges of contactability
              and network dormancy, whilst the advanced customer analytics made
              it possible to adjust the service component of the customer’s
              package downwards to match their current affordability profile.

            <h2>Behavioural Data Science</h2>
            <p>
              We find neuropsychology fascinating at Matogen AI, so have made a
              short study of it here. With Black Friday ad campaigns
              circulating, it seemed appropriate to relate it to consumer
              behaviour. Behavioural Data Science, in a nutshell, is using
              computers to understand humans – and influence their behaviour.
              <br /><br />

              For decades, “behavioural analytics” has been the term used to
              describe the process of using theory from non-financial fields
              such as psychology, neuroscience, economics, sociology and
              anthropology,&nbsp; to understand consumer purchasing behaviour.
              Within the South African market research landscape, the “<a
                href="http://tns-global.ge/?page_id=154#:~:text=The%20Conversion%20Model%20is%20a,world's%20leading%20measure%20of%20commitment."
                >Conversion model</a
              >”, a seminal psychological model to measure the strength of the
              relationship between consumers and brands, was developed from
              theory relating to religious conversion. For many years, it was
              used with great success to predict churn and quantify customer
              loyalty.&nbsp;
            </p>

            <h3>Social science theory: ‘The why behind the panic buy‘</h3>
            <p>
              Recently, many retailers (and consumers!) were caught unawares by
              the waves of “panic buying” at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
              Traditional timeseries purchasing data was useless in predicting
              this highly disruptive phenomenon, whereas theories from the
              realms of economics and psychology could have proven useful in
              predicting and mitigating these occurrences.
              <br /><br />
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              For example, Nobel prize winning economist Daniel Kahnemann’s
              “loss aversion” states that humans experience financial loss more
              profoundly than financial gain. In the context of panic buying,
              people were alarmed at the anticipated pain of not having access
              to products they normally would. Such risk aversion caused people
              to buy anything they set their eyes on for fear of not being able
              to do so later. Another Economics Nobel prize winner, Richard
              Thaler, wrote extensively about behaviour-nudging heuristics,
              a.k.a. “copycat behaviour”. During the early stages of the
              pandemic, consumers observing others buying large amounts of a
              particular item, were inclined to jump on the same bandwagon. No
              doubt this phenomenon was exacerbated and entrenched by the
              constant stream of social media and news reports showcasing this
              herd like behaviour.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              In addition, psychologists have contributed theories regarding the
              human need for control during periods of stress. As such,
              stockpiling could be considered an amplified form of retail
              therapy in an attempt to assert control. Social scientists have
              even highlighted the soothing effects of buying utilitarian
              products specifically, i.e. items that “give you something to do”,
              which coincidentally tied in very well with actual types of
              products (food and cleaning products) that were being stockpiled!

              “Game Theory” is another Nobel prize winning economics
              contribution, formulated by John Nash which famously entered the
              public lexicon in the Oscar-winning film, “A Beautiful Mind”. It
              assumes rational (and self-preserving!) reasons that could explain
              panic-buying: Out of two competing strategies, act normally or
              panic buy, normal purchasing behaviour would result in a state of
              equilibrium. However, once the panic buying has already started,
              the optimal strategy would be to do the same.

            <h3>Enter algorithms and big data</h3>
            <p>
              With the emergence of AI technologies, the insights provided by
              behavioural theory can now be leveraged further using a range of
              methodological tools from statistics, computer science and
              engineering. As described by the Alan Turing Institute, “Human
              behaviour is a major source of data in the current digital
              economy. At the same time, it is also one of the main ‘objects’ of
              data science in the sense that many data science and artificial
              intelligence models are aimed at influencing human behaviour (e.g.
              through ‘nudging’, personalisation, and behavioural
              segmentation).”

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              Applying behavioural science to increasingly large datasets, human
              behaviour can now, better than ever, be understood and predicted
              across a variety of applications ranging from health,
              telecommunications, finance and development. Behavioural data
              science can help cities, businesses, governments and individuals
              understand why and how human decisions are made and inform how to
              optimise behaviour to achieve better outcomes.

            <h2>Tuberculosis Monitoring Dashboard</h2>
            <p>
              In one of Matogen Applied Insights’ (MAI) earliest
              <a
                href="https://ai.matogen.com/big-data-in-healthcare/"

                >health sector data science projects</a
              >, a US-based medical company approached the team to create a
              tuberculosis monitoring dashboard using clinical trial data,
              including an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and
              wrangling process.<span style="font-size: inherit"> </span>
            </p>

            <h3>Monitoring tuberculosis patients</h3>
            <p>
              Keeping track of tuberculosis patients is critical as there are
              various exogenous and endogenous risk factors that influence the
              likelihood of developing active disease following exposure to
              tuberculosis bacilli. In addition, traditional monitoring
              approaches to track HIV or TNF (Tuberculosis Necrosis Factor), for
              example, rely primarily on costly and time intensive on-site
              visits and source data verification. In order to mitigate these
              difficulties, regulatory agencies encourage adopting a risk-based
              monitoring (RBM) approach that identifies and tracks critical data
              and procedures regarding the overall impact on trial integrity and
              subject safety.
            </p>

            <h3>Data wrangling and visualisation</h3>
            <p>
              As the first step in the ETL process, the MAI data scientist coded
              a SAS script to extract the source information from the clinical
              database and then transformed the aggregate patient attributes
              into a usable format. The output data was then connected and
              loaded into Power BI, creating a dashboard that visualises
              critical data elements for all the participant sites involved. It
              used the R-script functionality within Power BI to deliver
              detailed visualisations, including risk factor diagrams,
              individual site performance analysis featuring interactive plots
              as well as drill-down capabilities.
              <br /><br />

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              This tuberculosis monitoring dashboard ensures that critical
              information reaches the right people in a timeous manner in a
              format that is easy to interpret even for the non-statistical
              end-user. By utilising Power BI, the automated process “refreshes”
              functionality, thereby ensuring that the provision of tuberculosis
              risk data is consistent, actionable and readily available to all
              clinical project management team members.

            <h2>Agri 3.0 – Plant Disease Image Recognition</h2>
            <p>
              This article showcases Matogen Applied Insights’(MAI) analytics
              capabilities within the agricultural sector, examining how
              employing deep learning for plant disease image recognition can be
              used to identify crop disease.
            </p>

            <h3>Plant pathology</h3>
            <p>
              Even in the modern era, plant disease still poses significant
              risks to crops, despite the widespread use of crop protection
              products. In fact, misdiagnosing plant disease can result in the
              misuse of chemicals, leading to the emergence of resistant
              pathogen strains. This, in turn, results in increased input costs
              and more outbreaks, impacting profitability, as well as the
              environment. Currently, disease diagnosis is conducted by humans,
              which is both a labour- and cost-intensive. Thanks to advances in
              computer vision technology, there is an opportunity to employ
              deep-learning based modelling to enable automated plant disease
              image recognition in order to increase efficiency in this process.
            </p>
            <h3>University of Stellenbosch Plant Disease Clinic</h3>
            <p>
              The Department of Plant Pathology at the University of
              Stellenbosch utilizes the latest technology as part of its
              holistic and interdisciplinary approach towards limiting the
              impact of plant diseases. In its research and training,
              conventional and molecular techniques are combined to control
              plant pathogens and increase plant resistance in a sustainable and
              economic manner for the benefit of both local and export markets.
              The department features research programmes in grape, deciduous
              fruit, citrus, vegetable and cereal crop disease.

              The department also contains the Plant Disease Clinic, a service
              laboratory where specialists in the field of plant pathology
              diagnose problems on received samples. Diagnosis is conducted on
              bacterial, fungal and viral disease. The clinic also offers an
              insect identification service in cooperation with the university’s
              etymology department. Digital images, either via a conventional
              camera or smartphone, or through a microscope lens, have become a
              useful diagnostic aid, enabling verification by experts worldwide.

            <h3>Plant disease image recognition</h3>
            <p>
              Building on this methodology, Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) has
              been providing ongoing technical support to the Plant Disease
              Clinic by engineering a comprehensive platform and workflow
              system. The platform includes a database incorporating migrated
              historic institutional data, reports and images. Preventing loss
              of historic information is crucial, especially in the case of rare
              plant disease.

              The plant disease data warehouse contained within this platform
              enables detailed trend analysis and cutting-edge modelling. The
              machine learning technique, Convoluted Neural Network, was applied
              to the vast repository of plant disease images, in order to
              construct a model that would identify a specific plant disease on
              a previously unseen image (in theory, sent from the field on a
              smartphone, for example) with high levels of accuracy.
              <br /><br />

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              The model is able to classify a given image into “diseased” or
              “healthy” categories with great accuracy. Subsequently,
              distinctions are made between many different types of diseases.
              Rare cases and novel symptoms are also accommodated and variations
              in depth perception (angle, light, shade, leaf age) are addressed.
              In addition, the platform allows for the incorporation of expert
              knowledge for identifying, annotating, quantifying and guiding the
              computer vision search for relevant features.
            </p>
            <h3>Computer vision use case</h3>
            <p>
              Efficiency increases gained by the type of modelling outlined
              above, pose unparalleled opportunities to save time and money in
              combating plant disease, ultimately improving food security.

            <h3>What is “Big Data” in healthcare?</h3>
            <p>
              “Big data” is commonly and academically defined to have three
              significant characteristics: volume, variety and velocity. One of
              the key industries where generated data adheres to these
              definitions to a large extent is the healthcare industry.
              Tellingly, at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, big data
              originating from the health sector was instrumental in developing
              models used as critical inputs for governments worldwide to devise
              their response strategy.

              Even under non-pandemic conditions, the medical industry produces
              a myriad of health-related data, including electronic health
              records, scanned imagery, sensor data, and financial information..
              Analysing these types of data allows for a plethora of enhanced
              services such as disease prediction and prevention, optimised
              treatment plans, the development of new drugs, telemedicine
              (remote diagnosis of disease), real-time alerting, insurance fraud

            <h2>Engineering Credit Data</h2>
            <p>
              Engineering credit data has become imperative considering the
              increasingly risky and competitive lending environment. In order
              to improve decisioning, credit providers often leverage bureau
              summary variables which are generally calculated from credit
              bureau data sources. This includes credit account data, deeds
              office information, collections and microlending data.
            </p>

            <h3>Bureau information gaps</h3>
            <p>
              However, there are gaps in the current set of most bureau summary
              variables. Certain types of behaviour are not captured and this
              results in improper risk management. A “risk paradox” can result
              where, for example, a reverse ranking where the observed risk is
              not in line with the expected risk. Consequently, credit risk
              models are of limited used due to this deficiency in the
              variables.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              This project aimed to understand and fill the gaps in bureau
              summary variables. The Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) team
              reprocessed and imputed the raw payment strings received from the
              credit bureaus to create new variables that examine consumer
              behaviour at different overlapping and non-overlapping periods
              relative to each other. More than a hundred new variables were
              scoped with a focus on delinquency. The data scientists examined
              and visualised variable lists focusing on utilisation, payments,
              balances and instalments to illustrate a customer’s trajectory
              over time. Traditionally, customers displaying the same
              delinquency at a specific point would have been assigned the same
              risk. With additional insights, it is clear that while one might
              be improving, the other could be deteriorating. This process of
              engineering credit data makes it possible to assign different risk
              categories to customers.
            </p>
            <h3>Insights from engineered variables</h3>
            <p>
              As such, MAI was able to compensate for the shortcomings in
              traditional credit bureau data and identify payment behaviour
              trends over different periods. Bureau summary variables is an
              innovative way of using credit bureau data, which is generally not
              used to scrutinise historic data from more than one point in time.

            <h2>Agri 3.0 – Irrigation Model</h2>
            <p>
              Creating an irrigation model was one of Matogen Applied Insights’
              (MAI) earliest projects within the agricultural sector. It
              examined how data-driven farm management can optimise irrigation
              practices.
            </p>

            <h3>Crop irrigation optimisation</h3>
            <p>
              Due to population growth, industrialisation and contamination,
              there is increasing pressure on the amount of water available for
              irrigating agricultural crops. It has become critical to optimise
              crop irrigation to provide the most beneficial amount of water at
              the correct time, in order to maximise crop yields while limiting
              wastage. Too little water puts crops in excessive drought stress,
              whereas too much water results in waste and could potentially
              flood the nutrients away from the roots, hampering effective
              absorption, and therefore, yield.
              <br /><br />
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              Crop irrigation scheduling has traditionally been based on
              theoretical crop coefficient values, which are primarily based on
              annual seasonal changes. These values are used as a reference
              point when determining total water, crop and season allocations.
              However, these coefficients still have a coarse, monthly
              resolution at best and true water needs of crops deviate strongly,
              especially given increasingly erratic weather conditions.
            </p>
            <h3>Evaporation, Transpiration and Evapotranspiration</h3>
            <p>
              Evaporation is the process whereby liquid water is converted to
              water vapour, “vaporisation”, and removed from the evaporating
              surface, “vapour removal”. Water evaporates from a variety of
              surfaces, such as soil and wet vegetation, as well as lakes,
              rivers and pavements. The evaporation process is influenced by
              climatological parameters such as solar radiation, air
              temperature, air humidity and wind speed.
              <br /><br />
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              Transpiration denotes the vaporisation of liquid water contained
              in plant tissues and the vapour removal to the atmosphere. Crops
              predominately lose their water through stomata, small openings on
              the plant leaf through which gases and water vapour
              pass.Transpiration, like direct evaporation, is affected by
              weather conditions.
              <br /><br />

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              Evaporation and transpiration occur simultaneously and the
              processes are difficult to distinguish. Evaporation from cropped
              soil is mainly determined by the fraction of solar radiation
              reaching the soil surface, which decreases as crops develop and
              more canopy increases shade. Initially, water loss is largely due
              to evaporation, but at later crop growth stages, transpiration
              becomes the main process.

              Evapotranspiration is the combined name for the processes of
              evaporation and transpiration. It is abbreviated as ETc and is
              used to express crop water usage. It varies from region to region
              depending on crop type, stage of growth, soil, and climate
              conditions. Different evapotranspiration rates may be observed
              even in different parts of the same region. Considering global
              warming and climate change in recent years, it is clear that the
              predicted ET values of a year cannot be used safely for upcoming
              years.

            <h3>Crop irrigation model</h3>
            <p>
              An international client in the agriculture sector contracted
              Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) to analyse data derived from
              telemetry readings from on-site probes dedicated to measuring the
              water moisture at various depths. This data was combined with
              climate data, specifically temperature, to enhance crop water
              requirement predictions.
              <br /><br />

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              By exploring the data it was revealed that there was a significant
              deviation of (30% – 50%) between expected and actual crop water
              consumption. An algorithm was created to derive a more refined
              crop coefficient curve from probe readings. In addition, these new
              crop coefficients were linked to heat readings from annual
              temperature data to produce more nuanced predictions that
              accommodate temperature fluctuations within seasons, instead of
              only using the broader time definition, “season”. A feedback loop
              was created to update and improve the water crop coefficient in an
              iterative fashion, continually improving model performance.

            <h3>Agricultural software</h3>
            <p>
              MAI’s predictive irrigation model was incorporated into a
              multifunctional agricultural software product developed by its
              sister company, Matogen Corporate Software Development. It
              delivers an irrigation scheduling tool that can be used with a
              wide range of telemetry devices and along with the other product
              components, offers actionable information on a variety of
              agricultural aspects, including weather and spray condition
              forecasts and soil classification — all of which are critical for
              efficient and sustainable farm management.

                misfortune or change.” Based on many years of clinical research,
                a team of neuroscientists developed an innovative code to
                deliver insights into human resilience and how it can drive high
                performance teams within the corporate realm. The client
                approached Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) to engineer an

            <h3>Analysis and recommendations</h3>
            <p>
              MAI analysed historical data, and devised a data-driven
              expert-validated model utilising the client domain expertise, i.e.
              “the neuroscience expert system”. This model not only measures
              resilience, but also identifies the most impactful actions towards
              improvement. The model was used to build a software application
              that provides users with commendations on areas in which they are
              already performing well and recommendations for most impactful
              improvement.

            <h3>Model stability and segmentation</h3>
            <p>
              In order to ensure that the population on which the model was
              built matches the observed population, the monitoring phase of the
              project includes calculating the Population Stability Index (PSI)
              which measures the discrepancy between the expected and actual
              populations.

              In addition, the MAI data scientist applied collaborative
              filtering to examine the relationships between the variables,
              including the Resilience Index. Collaborative filtering is an
              advanced statistical technique that simultaneously assesses
              similarities between respondents and constructs to detect
              relationships. It is a method often used in recommender systems
              such as Netflix. MAI has also successfully incorporated this
              method for a major listed South African telecoms company for its
              campaigns. In this project, collaborative filtering clearly
              identified four clear segments within the data. Finally, linear
              regression was conducted which delivered the outstanding insight
              that five constructs could explain almost 70% of the outcome under
              scrutiny!

              In this ongoing project, the information captured in the
              neuroscience expert system and analytics engine are updated
              according to the ever-widening academic knowledge base, which, in
              addition to on-going monitoring, ensures the accuracy of the

            <h2>Commercial Lending Risk Modelling</h2>
            <p>
              The COVID pandemic constitutes a Black Swan event, of which the
              economic consequences have only started to unfold. According to a
              McKinsey report, the sudden and simultaneous depression in supply
              and demand resulted in typical credit-risk data becoming “obsolete
              overnight”. Traditional 6 and 12 month old data were no longer
              suitable for identifying the resilience of individual borrowers.
              During the latter half of 2020, Matogen Applied Insights (MAI)
              joined forces with a commercial lending company to conduct
              internal risk modelling for approving loans for new and existing
              clients.
            </p>

            <h3>Data engineering</h3>
            <p>
              Due to a shortage of behavioural data, demographic metrics were a
              significant input into filling information gaps. In collaboration
              with the client, the MAI data scientist created variables which
              proved to be innovative business metrics in that they were
              unrelated to other variables and provided significant lift.
              Logistic regression was applied to the augmented dataset and a
              model was constructed using credit bureau modelling techniques,
              facilitating the credit approval process.
            </p>
            <h3>Commercial lending risk modelling</h3>
            <p>
              During the second phase of the project, the MAI data scientist
              added macro-economic data using the one-factor Merton model to
              adapt the credit scorecard for the pandemic-and-beyond trading
              environment. Linear regression was performed with macroeconomic
              indicators, including interest rates, unemployment figures,
              inflation indices, GDP and exchange rates. Model performance was
              checked with cross-validation and used to establish the solvency
              of clients. The portfolio’s time variation or systematic risk
              could then be explained and forecasted, allowing better business
              decisions.
            </p>
            <h3>Monitoring and machine learning segmentation</h3>
            <p>
              MAI delivered a model that predicts the likelihood of default,
              given current macro economic conditions. Model performance
              continues to be monitored and has been found to be stable.
              Significantly, the model has resulted in an increase in loan
              approvals, despite exceedingly challenging market circumstances.

            <p>
              A major South African telecoms company found that its marketing
              and sales endeavours were hampered by the high velocity in
              customer contact information changes, particularly within their
              specific target market. To improve the situation, Matogen Applied
              Insights (MAI) offered guidance on how to combine data assets from
              across the client company’s subsidiaries to provide a
              comprehensive corpus of accurate and verifiable customer
              information. Applying data analytics and artificial intelligence,
              this project’s core deliverable was a singular, accurate “View of
              Client”, of which “Right Party Contact” information is the
              critical element.
            </p>
            <h3>Data engineering and modelling</h3>
            <p>
              The client provided Matogen AI with data from various internal
              sources across the group; the information was analysed and used to
              build an expert model. After examining a variety of attributes,
              the model was ranked based on recency and frequency logic.
              Validation on right party contact (RPC) was done by comparing the
              data to trusted external data sources. MAI was able to achieve an
              average performance of 80% reliability that contact information,
              indeed, was current and accurate. This is much higher than the
              industry average.

            <h3>Smart farming</h3>
            <p>
              “Precision farming”, also known as “smart farming”, is an integral
              part of the Third Agricultural Revolution and pertains to the use
              of digital technologies as a crop management tool to monitor and
              optimise agricultural production. Vast amounts of farm data are
              collected via a plethora of devices, for example sensors,
              satellites and probes, as well as data from leaf, soil and fruit
              sampling. The data is combined, analysed and subjected to machine
              learning methodologies in order to derive insights that aim to
              guide decision-making — the ultimate objective being to optimise
              food production efficiency through increased yields at lower

              Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) concluded a project for a major
              client in the South African agriculture sector which entailed
              using several sources of data to predict harvest dates where fruit
              would be at its “peak vegetative stage”. Significant inputs into
              this process were readings for Normalised Difference Vegetation
              Index (NDVI), as well as Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is calculated
              based on data obtained from satellite imagery. It measures the
              relationship between the amount of near-infrared light reflected
              by plants and the amount of reflected visible light. Healthy
              plants reflect more near-infrared light and absorb more red light
              in comparison to other wavelengths.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              The Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) is also derived from satellite
              image calculations based on how plants reflect light, as well as
              aerosol resistance. As such, EVI conveys more information about
              canopy structure, whereas NDVI indicates the presence of
              chlorophyll. These NDVI and EVI indices are complementary in
              assessing vegetation based on image data from space.

              Vegetation Indices are an important indicator of “peak vegetative

            <h3>Data wrangling, feature engineering and modelling</h3>
            <p>
              The client provided MAI with data detailing both the NDVI and EVI
              for more than a dozen grape cultivars. In addition, almost a
              decade’s worth of growth stage data was supplied for a selection
              of farm blocks dissimilar in age and in different locations.
              Specifically, the time series data for the growth stages for the
              “bud”, “bloom”, “veraison” (when grapes turn from yellow to green
              or red) and “harvest”, as well as the “initial planting date”, was
              included.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              The different types of data were combined and new variables
              created in order to produce time series plots to identify trends
              pertaining to the crop growth stages and examine differences in
              respect to farm block age and location.

              After exploratory data analysis, correlations between the
              variables were examined to determine which relationships were most
              significant with regards to the outcome variable
              “days_until_harvest”. Subsequently, a variety of techniques were
              applied, including Multiple Linear Regression, XGBoost Regressor
              and Random Forest Regressor. Multiple Linear Regression is an
              extension of Simple Linear Regression and is a technique used to
              predict the outcome variable, using two or more other variables.
              XGBoost Regression and Random Forest Regression have the same
              objective but use a Decision Tree methodology.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              This process produced a model that achieved an R2 score of 98.1%
              accuracy on test set data when attempting to predict optimal
              harvesting dates for maximum crop yield. It means that given new,
              unseen (but known) harvest date data, the model was able to
              predict “days_until_harvest” impressively accurately.
            </p>
            <h3>Harvest date prediction use case</h3>
            <p>
              The insights gained from applying machine learning techniques to a
              combination of disparate types of agricultural data enable
              improved planning and management of the planting and harvesting of
              crops. Better harvest scheduling would result in lower crop
              losses, as well as optimise the application of crop protection
              products, i.e at the most impactful phase, whilst limiting
              residues at the point of export or retail. As more data is
              obtained, algorithms can be fine-tuned and improved to such an
              extent that future labour costs and time can be decreased,
              ultimately increasing efficiency in farming.

            <p>
              Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) used alternative data for credit
              scoring to create new scorecards for a financial services client.

            <h3>Alternative data</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400"
                >Traditionally, when assessing a potential customer’s credit
                risk, financial services providers have had to rely on
                information pertaining to the individual’s past credit
                activities, such as type of credit obtained, and utilisation,
                generally obtained from credit bureaus. In contrast, “<a

                  rel="noopener"
                  >alternative data</a
                >” is defined as any data not related to a client’s credit
                activity, yet provides crucial information about their habits,
                preferences, behavior, and character. It is important that
                alternative data originates from a source where it cannot be
                manipulated by the data subject. According to Experian,
                <a

                decisions.</span
              >

            <h3>Substitute scorecards</h3>
            <p>
              Credit bureau data proved limited for the customers of one of
              MAI’s financial services client, especially in several key
              portfolios. However, MAI was able to build substitute scorecards
              using “alternative customer data” from other purchasing data
              accessible within the client’s data warehouse.
              <br /><br />

              The MAI data scientist performed creative indirect matching to
              compensate for the large number of missing SA ID numbers of
              clients. In addition, purchasing data was analysed to reveal a
              plethora of attributes with good predictive strength. MAI created
              a framework using this novel data to generate new descriptive
              features and predictive models, which delivered additional
              insights into customers and their behaviour. These substitute
              scorecards were shown to perform very well compared to those
              produced by traditional credit bureaus.
            </p>
            <h3>Marketing and compliance</h3>
            <p>
              This alternative data credit scoring framework will be used
              internally on an ongoing basis to guide decision-making on
              marketing ethics and strategies to unlock new opportunities. For
              example, it would mitigate risk to the end-consumer due to
              over-indebtedness and incorrect product offerings. In general, the
              aim is to increase knowledge of South African consumers, and
              improve the predictive power of models, as well as boost
              compliance.

            <h2>Agri 3.0 – Weather and Plant Disease Risk Alert System</h2>
            <p>
              In the spirit of Agri 3.0, Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) created
              a sophisticated weather and plant disease risk alert system, using
              data and technology to mitigate the potentially dire repercussions
              of crop failure
            </p>

            <h3>Weather-related crop disease</h3>
            <p>
              Throughout the centuries, crop diseases often obliterated entire
              harvests, the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s being a famous
              example of Potato Late Blight which led to mass starvation and
              emigration. The disease in question, Potato Blight (Phytophthora
              infestans), is a fungal infection caused by spores transported by
              wind and develops on susceptible plants when weather conditions
              are favourable, i.e. warm and humid.
              <br /><br />

              <span style="font-weight: 400"
                >To this day, crop losses due to Potato Blight amount to
                <a
                  href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/40095536_Societal_Costs_of_Late_Blight_in_Potato_and_Prospects_of_Durable_Resistance_Through_Cisgenic_Modification"
                  >billions of US dollars worldwide</a
                >, despite the scientific advances in chemical crop protection.
                This could be attributed to ever-increasing temperature and
                humidity levels effectively expanding the areas at risk, as well
                the existence of a wider variety of strains of fungal infections </span
              ><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span
              ><span style="font-weight: 400"

              >
            </p>
            <h3>Smith and Hutton Periods</h3>
            <p>
              <span style="font-weight: 400"
                >Agricultural scientists have defined a formal description of
                the weather conditions conducive to Potato Blight. Initially, a
                “<a
                  href="https://www.allotment-garden.org/vegetable/potatoes/potato-blight/#:~:text=Smith%20Periods%20%26%20Hutton%20Periods&amp;text=A%20'Smith%20period'%20is%20a,during%20the%20final%2024%20hour"
                  >Smith Period</a
                >” referred to a 48 hour period during which the minimum
                temperature measures 10°C or greater, in addition to the
                relative humidity exceeding 90% for at least 11 hours during the
                first 24 hour period, and then again for at least 11 hours
                during the final 24 hour period. A more recent, and simpler,
                definition is the “Hutton Period”, which denotes two consecutive
                days with minimum air temperatures of 10°C and relative humidity
                of more than 90% for at least 6 hours.</span

            <h3>Plant disease risk prediction</h3>
            <p>
              Increasingly, using agricultural data to predict plant disease has
              become an essential tool in crop management. This type of
              forecasting is necessary to justify each instance of fungicide
              application and optimise the timing, targeting, and dosage.
              Several factors influence the risk for plant disease, including
              the crop flowering stage, petal or airborne spore inoculum levels
              and weather conditions. A Risk Score is calculated based on these
              variables.
            </p>
            <h3>Weather risk alert system</h3>
            <p>
              MAI was contracted to automate and improve the client’s system.
              Our automated system applies cloud-based algorithms to weather
              data to calculate indices for disease risk for several diseases.
              When specified risk thresholds are reached, email and text
              messages are sent out automatically to users to alert them of
              heightened disease risk. The system also provides a
              high-resolution risk map and various relevant weather metrics.
              Crucially, the system also includes recommendations relating to
              risk mitigation, for example, which protection products would be
              required and when spraying conditions would be ideal.
              <br /><br />

              In addition, MAI provides service support to that the risk alert
              system functions optimally. The risk alert data generated by the
              system is used to analyse trends in crop risks so that the models
              can be improved. User behaviour is also tracked for product
              improvement and business intelligence purposes. The tailor-made
              product can easily be adapted to include a greater variety of
              crops and diseases.and dosage. Several factors influence the risk
              for plant disease, including the crop flowering stage, petal or
              airborne spore inoculum levels and weather conditions. A Risk
              Score is calculated based on these variables.

              financial modelling generated an algorithm that identifies optimal
              opportunities for trades on different crypto exchanges, on both
              long and short positions. At the same time risk is minimised by
              taking counterpositions where there is an opportunity for
              arbitrage.

            <h2>Agri 3.0 – Plant Nutrient Deficiency Prediction</h2>
            <p>
              In one of Matogen Applied Insights’ (MAI) flagship agricultural
              analytics projects, the data science team examined how modelling
              leaf analysis data can enable crop nutrient deficiency prediction.
            </p>

            <h3>Plant leaf analysis</h3>
            <p>
              Plant leaf analysis is the only truly accurate means to determine
              whether plants are suffering from nutrient deficiencies and what
              the consequent nutritional requirements are. It is a critical
              component of the farm management process to inform decision-making
              surrounding the dosage and frequency of fertiliser application, in
              order to optimise efficiency and environmental sustainability.

              <a class="button" href="#covid" target="_blank">Read more</a>
              The leaf analysis process is labour and time intensive, mainly due
              to the physical leaf sampling process as well as transportation to
              laboratories. Once the leaf sample arrives at the laboratory, a
              variety of tests are conducted to obtain as much information as
              possible from the sample. A wide range of nutrients can be
              measured including macronutrients such as nitrogen, potassium and
              phosphate, major nutrients such as calcium, sulphur and magnesium,
              as well as heavy metals such as lead, nickel, arsenic, cadmium,
              chromium, mercury, copper and zinc.
            </p>
            <h3>Leaf sample analysis and modelling</h3>
            <p>
              A client, a major player in the South African agricultural sector,
              approached Matogen Applied Insights (MAI) to conduct a pilot study
              to analyse a vast amount of leaf analysis data to identify trends
              and examine the feasibility of “virtual sampling”. The primary
              objective of analysing the data was to determine in which areas
              sufficient numbers of samples were required to conduct the next
              phase of the exercise, “virtual sampling”.

              For the initial stage of the project the focus was on soybeans and
              maize, as well as winter wheat crops in KwaZulu-Natal.
            </p>
            <h3>Data analysis and modelling</h3>
            <p>
              Analysing the data revealed that the number of samples taken
              varied greatly across province and growth stage. MAI developed a
              simple model based on the frequency of the nutrient levels of
              interest and the number of samples for specific areas to produce a
              matrix highlighting sampling priority per crop, location and

              In areas where sufficient numbers of samples were taken, leaf
              sample data was combined with NDVI and weather station data to
              examine correlations. New variables were created to measure
              specific relationships. Statistical modelling techniques were
              applied to predict likelihood of nutrient deficiencies at specific
              locations. The most effective method produced a model for plant
              nutrient deficiency prediction with 95% precision on test data.

            <h3>Virtual sampling</h3>
            <p>
              Virtual sampling involves making inferences about a sample using
              historical leaf samples and other data. The model produced by MAI
              sets the stage to explore the extent to which virtual sampling can
              be used to decrease the number of physical plant leaf samples
              required. As this aspect of leaf analysis is the most costly, as
              mentioned above, reducing the number of samples required without
              decreasing information derived would lead to significant cost and
              efficiency gains in this crucial aspect of agriculture management.
              Prioritising physical leaf sample-taking at the locations and
              during the growth stages highlighted in the data analysis
              component of the project would enable the implementation of
              “virtual sampling”.

            <p>
              In one of many health sector Big Data projects, Matogen Applied
              Insights (MAI) performed oncology data modelling for an
              international client.

                across a spectrum of demographics, regions and genetic profiles,
                have rendered traditional analytics tools defunct. The advanced
                computer modelling and wrangling provided by data scientists

            <h3>Oncological data modelling</h3>
            <p>
              In this project, oncological data was extracted from a large,
              publicly available, all-payer, inpatient healthcare database
              designed to produce regional and national estimates of inpatient
              utilisation, access, charges, quality, and outcomes for the United
              States.

              The oncological data modelling determined which outcome was most
              probable in patients (based on their attributes) with breast
              cancer and what route of intervention to follow based on the
              result. For example, this aided oncologists in deciding whether to
              administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy or perform invasive surgery on
              the patient before administering chemo.

              This study also interrogated the possibility of predicting the
              downstaging of a tumour and the level of lymphovascular invasion
              after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
