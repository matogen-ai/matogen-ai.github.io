                            We love data, but we love intelligent decision-making derived from clean, optimised data more. It seems simple, but managing data sets at scale, and applying the correct analytical approaches, require deep expertise combined with excellent data architecture.

                            With metrics measured hourly for millions of locations, and including diverse data sources, weather stations and proprietary data, agricultural projects can plan for the future. Matogen Applied Insights has proven success with predicting crop yield, modelling plant nutrient levels and examining maximum residue limits on fruit in South Africa and globally.<br>
</p>
<h3>Manage risk</h3>
<p>

Using Databricks to process and analyse weather data, and combine it with proprietary agricultural sector data – including telemetry readings, soil and leaf sample data, and harvest dates – we produce statistical models to anticipate and plan for adverse events.
</p>
<h3>
    Sustainable farming operations
</h3>
<p>

Through precision agriculture, farming operations can improve harvest quality and yield, reduce the use of chemical fertilisers and optimise water usage.

                        <p>
                            Databricks is a data analytics platform made by the creators of Apache Spark. The platform speeds up innovations by synthesising engineering, data science and business operations. The program is maximised for businesses that are involved in financial services, advertising, public sectors, enterprise technology software, telecommunications, energy and utilities, healthcare, industrial sectors, media and entertainment, and internet technology.

                            As a cloud-native platform, Databricks also allows collaboration with different programming languages such as Python, SQL, R, and Scala for machine learning models. The interactivity of the platform makes it easier for users to visualise by point and click and scripting options such as D3, ggplot, and matplotlib.
                            
                            The multilevel data security of Databricks is another benefit that is inherent in the platform, which has options for adjusting access whether for identity management, fine-grained or role-based controls, data encryption, auditing, and compliance standards.
                            
                            If you’d like to find out more about Databricks, get in touch to schedule a call.
